PutCallParityTheory.pdf,finance,2025-11-12,2025-11-12,"Mathematically, this can be represented as:Call price = Put price + Underlying price - Strike priceThis equation highlights the relationship between call options (Calls) and put options (Puts). The underlying asset price (Underlying) plays a crucial role in determining the parity. When the underlying price is above the strike price, the call option's value increases, whereas the put option's value decreases. Conversely, when the underlying price is below the strike price, the put option's value increases, and the call option's value decreases.From a risk perspective, Put-Call Parity helps identify mispriced options. If an investor can buy a put option at a lower price than what they could sell a corresponding call option for, it implies that the market is underestimating the underlying asset's volatility or overestimating its mean reversion. This disparity creates an arbitrage opportunity, allowing investors to profit from the mispricing.Conversely, if an investor can buy a call option at a lower price than what they could sell a corresponding put option for, it suggests that the market is underestimating the underlying asset's mean reversion or overestimating its volatility. This disparity also presents an arbitrage opportunity.In conclusion, Put-Call Parity is a crucial concept in derivatives pricing that ensures that options with the same characteristics trade at equal prices. By analyzing this parity, investors can identify mispriced options and potentially capitalize on arbitrage opportunities."
Options Fundamentals.pdf,finance,2025-11-12,2025-11-12,"Options, in particular, give the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price (strike price) before a specified date (expiration date). This unique characteristic makes options valuable for managing risk and speculating on market movements.From a mathematical perspective, options can be modeled using stochastic processes, such as the Black-Scholes equation. This partial differential equation describes the time-evolution of an option's value, taking into account factors like volatility, interest rates, and the underlying asset's price dynamics.In terms of risk implications, options introduce unique challenges due to their non-linear nature. A small change in the underlying asset's price can have a disproportionate impact on the option's value, leading to increased uncertainty and potential losses for traders.To better understand the intricacies of options, let's break down some key concepts:1. Types of options: Calls give the holder the right to buy the underlying asset, while puts give them the right to sell.
2. Strike price: The predetermined price at which the option can be exercised.
3. Expiration date: The last day on which the option can be exercised.
4. Volatility: A measure of the underlying asset's price fluctuations, which affects option values.
5. Time value: The excess value an option has due to the time remaining until expiration.By grasping these fundamental concepts and incorporating them into mathematical models, we can better understand the complexities of options and develop strategies for risk management and profit optimization.In the next installment, we'll delve deeper into the intricacies of options pricing models, exploring topics like the Black-Scholes equation, binomial model, and Monte Carlo simulations."

The model takes market observables such as spot price, strike, volatility, interest rate, and time to calculate ""fair"" prices. The formula for call and put options involves the normal distribution function N(d1) and N(d2), with d1 and d2 calculated using the log of the spot price, strike, volatility, interest rate, and time.Each input has a clear role in the option's value: increasing time, volatility, or underlying asset price increases the call option's value, while decreasing the put option's value. Increasing interest rates also favors calls over puts. The model assumes continuous trading, perfect divisibility of assets, constant and positive volatility, European-style options with no dividends, and lognormal returns.However, these assumptions are unrealistic in practice: markets close, volatility clusters and shifts, investors face transaction costs, and many traded options are American style. To bridge the gap between theory and reality, practitioners must consider these limitations when applying the Black-Scholes model.The geometric Brownian motion (GBM) is a key concept underlying the Black-Scholes model, describing the evolution of stock prices over time. The GBM equation relates the change in stock price to the drift (expected return), volatility, and Wiener process dWt. Understanding the assumptions and limitations of the Black-Scholes model is crucial for accurately pricing options.Additionally, there are two types of volatility: historical volatility, which measures past returns, and implied volatility, which is inferred from market option prices. Traders use the Black-Scholes formula in reverse to estimate implied volatility. Implied volatility serves as a forward-looking indicator, hinting at where the market expects the underlying asset's price to go.In conclusion, the Black-Scholes model provides a powerful framework for pricing options, but its assumptions must be carefully considered in practice."

It provides a closed-form solution to value European options using market observables (spot price, strike, volatility, interest rate, time). The formula is:C = S0N(d1) - Ke^(-rT)N(d2)
P = Ke^(-rT)N(-d2) - S0N(-d1)where d1 and d2 are functions of the inputs. Each input plays a clear role in the option's value: time, volatility, spot price, and interest rate.**Implied vs. Historical Volatility**Volatility is crucial for option pricing. There are two types:* Historical volatility: the standard deviation of past returns.
* Implied volatility: the forward-looking number hidden inside market option prices.Traders use the Black-Scholes formula in reverse to find the implied volatility that matches today's market price.**Black-Scholes Assumptions**The model has five assumptions:1. Continuous trading (markets never close).
2. Assets are perfectly divisible.
3. Volatility is constant and strictly positive.
4. Options are European (exercise only at maturity).
5. No dividends or constant continuous yield q.These assumptions are mathematically convenient but unrealistic in practice. Practitioners must account for these gaps between theory and reality.**Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM)**The model assumes that stock prices follow a geometric Brownian motion:dSt = µSt dt + σSt dWtwhere:* dSt: change in stock price
* µ: drift (expected return)
* σ: volatility
* dWt: Wiener process (a random variable)This assumption is at the heart of the Black-Scholes model and has important implications for option pricing.That's a summary of the key concepts from Skema Business School. As a senior quant, I can assure you that these ideas are essential for anyone working in derivatives or fixed income markets."
Yield_Curve_Construction_A_Mathematical_Guide.pdf,finance,2025-11-12,2025-11-12,"The yield curve construction process involves bootstrapping methods to estimate the discount factors (P(t,T)) and spot yields (y(t,T)). The par curve bootstrapping method uses coupon bonds to calculate the discount factors recursively. On-the-run treasuries bootstrapping selects the most liquid benchmarks and applies the same recursion. Swap curve bootstrapping involves three steps: short-end deposits, forwards via FRAs/futures, and swaps (par conditions).The par condition for swaps ensures that the sum of discounted cash flows equals the present value of the swap. In a multi-curve setting, discounting is done on an OIS curve (Dd) while forwards come from a tenor-specific forwarding curve (Df). Interpolation methods include linear interpolation, cubic splines, penalized splines, and monotone convex interpolation.Linear interpolation assumes piecewise constant or linear behavior. Cubic splines minimize the sum of squared errors while smoothing the yield or log-discount function. Penalized splines ensure local control and stable fitting by penalizing differences of coefficients or integrated curvature.Monotone convex interpolation enforces monotonicity and shape-preservation between nodes, avoiding spurious oscillations. The choice of interpolation method depends on the specific application and risk implications."

Derivatives_and_Fixed_Income_Skema_Business_School_Hailie.pdf",finance,2025-11-12,2025-11-12,"The lecture notes on derivatives and fixed income cover vanilla options and the Black-Scholes model. Vanilla options give the buyer a right but not an obligation to buy or sell an underlying asset at a fixed strike price. The call option allows the buyer to purchase the asset at the strike, while the put option allows selling at that strike. The seller must fulfill the opposite obligation if the buyer exercises.The value of an option before maturity is greater than its payoff at maturity due to the ""hope value"" of potential market movements. The main determinants of option price are the underlying spot price, strike price, time remaining, volatility of returns, and risk-free rate. More time and higher volatility increase the option's value, while a higher interest rate raises call values and lowers put values.The Black-Scholes model is used to calculate the European call option price as S0N(d1) - Ke^(-rT)N(d2), where d1 and d2 are functions of the underlying spot price, strike price, time remaining, volatility, and risk-free rate. The model also provides a formula for the European put option price using put-call parity.The key takeaways from the Black-Scholes model include:* Option value increases with time to maturity and volatility.
* Call options increase in value with a higher interest rate, while put options decrease in value.
* The model is based on several assumptions, including a constant risk-free rate, no dividends, and lognormality of asset returns.Overall, the lecture notes provide an introduction to derivatives and fixed income concepts, highlighting the importance of understanding option pricing models such as the Black-Scholes model."

""Partial Moments and Sigma Algebras: A Measure-Theoretic Reconciliation of Zeros and Measurability""

Please note that this file name is based on the provided text, but I did not make any changes to the content itself. If you would like me to revise or summarize the text for you, please let me know!pdf",finance,2025-11-12,2025-11-12,"The paper by Fred Viole (2025) reconciles the role of zeros in partial moment computations using measure-theoretic techniques. Partial moments are fundamental in probability theory and finance, but concerns arise about the impact of zeros on moment estimation. The author demonstrates that zeros are mathematically necessary features, not computational artifacts.The paper defines a probability space (Ω,F,𝑃) and introduces the concept of measurability for random variables. It then defines partial moments as Lebesgue integrals over measurable sets. These expectations inherit measure-theoretic guarantees from the underlying probability space.The author shows that canonical partial moments, such as LPM, necessarily involve zeros when evaluating the maximum function. Zeros reflect the probability mass of events {𝑋 > 𝑡} and ensure expectation spans the entire probability space.Empirical estimation using sample data also preserves zeros, representing the probability mass of events {𝑋 > 𝑡} under the empirical measure. The paper concludes that excluding zeros changes the estimand, breaking additivity and yielding an estimand that is not the expectation over Ω.The provided R implementation demonstrates the calculation of partial moments and their application to estimating sample variance. Overall, the paper provides a rigorous treatment of partial moments, highlighting the importance of zeros in these computations."
